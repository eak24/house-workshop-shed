# house-workshop-shed

I want to make a house (tiny + portable) that can get eventually be turned into my workshop, and then turned into my storage shed. 
I will make it out of a 40' high-cube shipping container. 
I will not modify or puncture the shipping container frame to ensure it stays weather proof.
I will only include modular furniture that can be entirely removed when I turn it into a shed.
